    <div class="description"><div>
        I’m Walter, a recent college graduate and proud adventurer, currently hiking South Bound (SOBO) on the Appalachian Trail. This website is my way of documenting the incredible journey, sharing stories, and reflecting on the challenges and triumphs of life on the trail.

        I began my thru-hike on July 27th, 2024, summiting the iconic Mt. Katahdin in Maine. From there, I embarked on the 2,200-mile journey southward, experiencing the beauty, serenity, and occasional chaos of life in the Appalachian Mountains.

    <div class="description"><div>
        Hiking the Appalachian Trail has been a dream of mine for years. It’s not just about covering miles; it’s about self-discovery, connecting with nature, and embracing the trail community along the way. As "Heisenberg"—my trail name inspired by both my love of Breaking Bad and my real name—I’ve made incredible memories and friends that I’ll carry with me for a lifetime.

        Currently, I’m making my way toward Waynesboro, Virginia, where I plan to take a short pause to volunteer and help with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Giving back to the communities that support hikers is an essential part of the journey for me—it’s a way to say thank you and to leave a positive impact wherever I go.

    <div class="top"><div><p>Why SOBO</p></div></div>
    <div class="description"><div>
        While most hikers choose to go North Bound (NOBO), I wanted the challenge and solitude that comes with hiking SOBO. Starting at Katahdin and heading south has allowed me to experience the trail in a unique way, tackling rugged terrains in Maine and New Hampshire early on while savoring the changing landscapes as I head toward Georgia.

        I hope this website serves as a place for friends, family, and fellow adventurers to follow my progress, get inspired, or learn more about what it takes to hike the AT. Whether you’re here for trail updates, gear reviews, or simply to share in the adventure, I’m glad to have you along for the journey.

        Thank you for stopping by, and happy trails!
